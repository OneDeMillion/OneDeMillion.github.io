        <h3 class="newsArticleH3">Social Distancing Outside</h3>
        <h4 class="newsArticleH5">by Kim DeMille</h5>
        <p>
            If you're practicing social distancing (as both the Centers for 
            Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization are 
            advising), chances are you're limiting trips outside your home to 
            protect your health and the health of your loved ones. But fresh 
            air is good for your health, too, and social distancing doesn't 
            have to be a strictly in-home activity. As temperatures warm around 
            the country, it's a great time to get outside. Plus, with fewer 
            people out and about, you'll be treated to sounds like birds and 
            trees blowing in the wind.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although most experts agree there's no problem with going outside, 
            there are some precautions you need to take. For example, the CDC 
            recommends keeping a distance of at least 6 feet from others. 
            Additionally, the CDC advises washing your hands for at least 20 
            seconds and using hand sanitizer often to prevent the spread of 
            the virus.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are just a few ways to shake off some of that cabin fever 
            and get moving.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the backyard, you don't run a risk of being around others 
            besides your family. While you see and spend time in your 
            yard often, it's time to give it a second look.

            If the weather is complying, how about having a family campout!
            
            Pitch a tent in the backyard and have a staycation. Tell stories, 
            eat s'mores and lie on a blanket to watch the stars as possible 
            activities.
            
            Others are taking this time to plant a vegetable garden or 
            flowers. One family is redesigning their backyard. They're 
            drawing sketches and letting everyone have a say in what they 
            want to include.
        </p>
        <p>
            As long as you stay a safe distance from others (remember: 6 feet), 
            heading to local trails or around your own neighborhood for a run, 
            walk, hike or bike ride are still great ways to get moving. Getting 
            outside also makes for a nice break from bingeing your favorite 
            shows and sitting on the couch for too long.
        </p>
        <p>
            But walking outside doesn't absolve you of the CDC's recommendations 
            against gathering in groups. California's governor, who has banned 
            its residents from leaving their homes for nonessential reasons, 
            still encourages residents to get active outside, but requires 
            that they not go out in large groups and maintain proper distance.
        </p>
        <p>
            What about playing a game in the Driveway? To make sure everyone 
            is getting some exercise, head out into the driveway for some fun. 
            Kids can use chalk to create hopscotch grids, play games or just draw. 
            Practice your shooting skills if you have a basketball hoop, or 
            engage the whole family in team sport like soccer.
